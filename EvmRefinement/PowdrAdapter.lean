/-! Opt-in adapter surface for `powdr-labs/evm-semantics`.

This module is intentionally outside the default `ProofForge` root. Building
the `EvmRefinement` Lake target pulls powdr + mathlib and proves that the
preferred Phase 6b surface is available, while the default CLI/library build
keeps using the mathlib-free seam in `ProofForge.Backend.Evm.EvmBytecodeSemantics`.

namespace ProofForge.Backend.Evm.PowdrAdapter

/-- Opt-in EVM bytecode state: the real powdr state. -/
abbrev State := EvmSemantics.EVM.State

/-- Opt-in relational EVM step: the real powdr `Step`. -/
abbrev Step : State → State → Prop := EvmSemantics.EVM.Step

abbrev ObservableStep := ProofForge.Backend.Refinement.ObservableStep

/-- Raw powdr total executable step. It is identity-like on done states. -/
def rawStepF (state : State) : State :=
  EvmSemantics.EVM.stepF state

/-- Seam-compatible executable step.

The default mathlib-free seam uses `Except String State`, while powdr exposes a
total `State → State` plus a soundness theorem that requires the source state
not to be done. This wrapper turns accidental calls on done states into an
adapter error, so any successful result carries the precondition needed for
powdr's `stepF_sound`. -/
def stepF (state : State) : Except String State :=
  if state.isDone then
    .error "powdr stepF called on a done EVM state"
  else
    .ok (rawStepF state)

/-- Compatibility alias for single opcode-granular execution. -/
def step (state : State) : State :=
  rawStepF state

def isHalted (state : State) : Bool :=
  state.isDone

/-- Fuel-bounded powdr bytecode driver.

Observable projection is still a Phase 6c task, so this driver preserves the
same `Array ObservableStep` shape as the mathlib-free seam but returns no
observable steps yet. The important E2 fact is that state stepping is now the
real powdr executable step in the opt-in target. -/
