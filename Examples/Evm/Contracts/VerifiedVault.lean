A DeFi-style vault contract with formal verification, using typed storage
data structures (Storage.Var, Storage.Map) that mirror Solidity's storage
variable system.

This contract demonstrates the complete pattern for writing verified EVM
smart contracts in Lean:

1. Pure financial model with formally proven invariants
2. Typed storage layout (Solidity-style)
3. Reentrancy guard
4. Initialization guard
5. Events for deposit/withdraw
6. Proper checks-effects-interactions ordering

The formal proofs guarantee:
  - The vault is always solvent: reserves == totalShares
  - Deposit/withdraw preserve this invariant
  - A depositor's balance is bounded by total shares
