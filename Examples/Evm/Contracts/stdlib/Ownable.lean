Ownable - access control primitive (OpenZeppelin `access/Ownable.sol`).

Provides single-owner authorization via a `onlyOwner` guard. The owner is
set at initialization and can be transferred.

Solidity equivalent:
```solidity
contract Ownable {
    address private _owner;
    modifier onlyOwner() { ... }
    function owner() public view returns (address) { ... }
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public onlyOwner { ... }
}
```
