/-! ## Shallow total ValueVault IR semantics

This is a hand-crafted, shallow executable semantics for the ValueVault
contract. It directly computes the post-state and return value for each
entrypoint, avoiding the need to reduce the generic (partial) IR interpreter
inside proofs. It is used by `ValueVaultWasmRefinement` as the IR reference.

The shallow step is intentionally simple: it pattern-matches on the call,
updates the six scalar fields, and returns the appropriate `Option Value`.

/-! ## FV-9.0 M5: bridge `valueVaultIrStep` to the shared fueled interpreter

The shallow `valueVaultIrStep` directly computes the post-state for each
ValueVault call. The shared fuel-indexed interpreter
(`ProofForge.IR.SemanticsFuel.runEntrypointWithArgsFuel`) executes the *actual*
IR entrypoint body. The bridge below witnesses that the two agree on the
ValueVault canonical trace's concrete args — i.e. the shallow step is a sound
summary of the real IR semantics for the args the refinement proofs use.

This is the M5 deliverable: ValueVault is now connected to the shared
interpreter (the `∀ module` theorem's quantification target) without
rewriting the abstract-core relation proofs that `ValueVaultWasmRefinement`
depends on. The full ∀-state/∀-args agreement is FV-9.2's scope; M5 only
needs the bridge to exist and the Wasm refinement smoke to stay green.
