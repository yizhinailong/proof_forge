# Capability Registry

Status: **Draft spec (Phase 1)**

Canonical capability ids for target profiles, artifact metadata, and compile-time
rejection. Semantic meanings align with the matrix in
[RFC 0002](rfcs/0002-target-implementation-design.md).

Legend: **Y** supported (planned or implemented), **P** partial/spike only,
**N** not supported, **—** not applicable.

## Relationship to target ids

- Target ids are recorded in `docs/decisions.md` and summarized by
  `docs/rfcs/0002-target-implementation-design.md`.
- This registry owns capability ids, not target lifecycle stages.
- Docs must not invent alternate ids for the same semantics.

## Id Naming Rules

- Format: `<domain>.<operation>` or `<domain>.<variant>` (lowercase, dot-separated).
- Domains: `storage`, `caller`, `value`, `events`, `crosscall`, `env`, `control`, `data`, `crypto`, `assertions`, `account`, `zk`.
- Artifact metadata lists the ids used by a build (see RFC 0002 artifact schema).
- Diagnostics must cite capability id and target id on rejection.

## Candidate Capabilities Not Yet Registered

These candidates are documented for target research only. Do not add them to
`ProofForge.Target.Capability` until a target profile and lowering rules are
accepted.

### Kaspa Toccata

See [Kaspa Toccata target](targets/kaspa-toccata.md).

| Candidate id | Portable meaning | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| `storage.utxo` | State lives in covenant-controlled UTXOs or state commitments | Not account/object storage and not EVM-style slots |
| `covenant.lineage` | Successor outputs remain in an authorized covenant family | Needed for transaction/output validation, not ordinary storage |
| `tx.v1` | Target uses Kaspa transaction v1 semantics | Transaction projection and payload rules affect correctness |

`zk.circuit` remains reserved for targets whose primary artifact is a circuit or
circuit-oriented source package. Toccata may use proofs, but its base target is
a Kaspa covenant package.

### Stellar Soroban

See [Stellar Soroban target](targets/stellar-soroban.md).

Most Soroban behavior can start from the existing Wasm-host capability set, but
several target semantics are not covered by the current registry.

### Algorand AVM

See [Algorand AVM target](targets/algorand-avm.md).

Algorand overlaps with generic contract capabilities, but AVM programs,
storage classes, transaction groups, and explicit resource references need
separate representation before a target profile is added.

|---|---|---|
| `avm.application` | Target emits stateful application approval and clear-state programs | Application artifacts have two AVM programs and app lifecycle semantics |

| `storage.local` | Contract uses account-local application state | State is keyed by account and app, not by a global contract map |
| `storage.box` | Contract uses box storage with explicit box references | Box access requires resource references and budget planning |
| `tx.group` | Contract depends on atomic transaction group ordering or inspection | Group semantics are target-native transaction context |

See [Tezos Michelson/LIGO target](targets/tezos-michelson-ligo.md).

Tezos overlaps with generic contract storage and entrypoints, but Michelson's
typed data, operation-list effects, views, events, tickets, and gas/storage-burn
semantics need explicit representation before a target profile is added.

### Starknet Cairo

See [Starknet Cairo target](targets/starknet-cairo.md).

Starknet overlaps with contract storage, events, and calls, but Cairo/Sierra/CASM
artifacts, class hashes, account abstraction, syscalls, and L1/L2 messaging need
explicit representation before a target profile is added.

| Candidate id | Portable meaning | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| `vm.cairo` | Target emits Cairo source for Starknet | Cairo is the source language and execution model boundary |

### TON TVM

See [TON TVM target](targets/ton-tvm.md).

TON overlaps with generic contract capabilities, but TVM cells, messages, and
actions need explicit representation before a target profile is added.

| Candidate id | Portable meaning | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| `storage.cell` | Contract state is encoded as TVM cells, slices, and builders | Not EVM slot storage or host KV |
| `abi.tlb` | Build emits or validates TL-B/cell layout metadata | Public data shape is cell-oriented |

### Bitcoin Script/Miniscript

See [Bitcoin Script/Miniscript target](targets/bitcoin-script-miniscript.md).

Bitcoin overlaps with UTXO script targets, but base-layer Script is best modeled
as spending policy rather than general contract execution. Miniscript,
descriptors, Taproot/Tapscript, PSBT flows, standardness, and weight/fee checks
need explicit representation before a target profile is added.

| Candidate id | Portable meaning | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| `script.bitcoin` | Target emits Bitcoin Script or script fragments | Bitcoin Script has distinct consensus and standardness rules |
| `script.miniscript` | Target emits analyzable Miniscript policy | Safer first artifact than raw Script for spending policies |
| `descriptor.output` | Target emits Bitcoin Core output descriptors | Descriptors drive wallet/address/script workflows |
| `script.segwit` | Target emits SegWit v0 script paths such as P2WPKH/P2WSH | SegWit witness semantics differ from legacy script paths |
| `script.taproot` | Target emits Taproot key-path or script-path outputs | Taproot changes address, commitment, and spend semantics |
| `script.tapscript` | Target emits or validates Tapscript semantics | Tapscript changes opcode and signature behavior |
| `witness.stack` | Artifact declares required witness stack items | Unlocking data is part of spend validation |
| `sighash.mode` | Signature semantics depend on explicit sighash flags | Sighash choice affects what the signature commits to |
| `hashlock.preimage` | Spending policy depends on revealing hash preimages | Common Bitcoin contract primitive |
| `multisig.threshold` | Spending policy uses threshold signatures or multisig structure | Not equivalent to account-level authorization |
| `psbt.flow` | Validation uses PSBT creation, signing, and finalization | Practical Bitcoin workflows are transaction-construction heavy |
| `policy.standardness` | Artifact checks relay/mining standardness policy | Consensus-valid scripts may still be non-standard |
| `fee.weight` | Artifact records transaction weight, vbytes, fee, and dust constraints | Fee and relay viability are part of practical correctness |
| `test.bitcoin_core` | Validation uses Bitcoin Core regtest or RPC checks | Target validation depends on Bitcoin Core behavior |

Bitcoin should reuse existing UTXO candidate ids where the semantics match,
including `storage.utxo`, `script.p2sh`, `script.unlocker`,
`timelock.locktime`, `signature.checksig`, and `tx.builder`.

### Zcash Shielded

See [Zcash Shielded target](targets/zcash-shielded.md).

Zcash overlaps with Bitcoin-derived UTXO flows, but its shielded pools are not
ordinary Bitcoin Script or a generic ZK circuit target. Sapling/Orchard notes,
nullifiers, commitment tree anchors, value-balance constraints, viewing-key
disclosure, and protocol-defined proofs need explicit representation before a
target profile is added.

| Candidate id | Portable meaning | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| `privacy.shielded` | Target uses a shielded value pool | Privacy is a transaction construction property, not only a proof flag |
| `privacy.transparent` | Target also handles transparent Zcash inputs or outputs | Transparent and shielded pools leak different information |
| `pool.sapling` | Target uses Sapling shielded semantics | Sapling has distinct notes, keys, and proof semantics |
| `pool.orchard` | Target uses Orchard shielded semantics | Orchard has action bundles and Halo 2 proof semantics |
| `note.shielded` | State/value unit is a shielded note | Not EVM storage, account state, or plain UTXO script data |
| `note.commitment` | Artifact records note commitment semantics | Needed for tree membership and output construction |
| `nullifier.reveal` | Spend reveals a nullifier as the double-spend guard | Public nullifiers are core to shielded spend validity |
| `anchor.commitment_tree` | Spend proves membership against a commitment tree anchor | Membership anchor is part of the public proof statement |
| `zk.zcash_proof` | Transaction carries a Zcash protocol proof | The circuit is protocol-defined, not arbitrary application code |
| `zk.witness` | Build requires private witness data for proving | Witness data must stay off-chain and auditable as a boundary |
| `value.balance` | Artifact records shielded value-balance constraints | Conservation across shielded pools and transparent turnstiles is target-specific |
| `key.viewing` | Validation/disclosure can use viewing keys | Off-chain observability is not contract state |
| `address.unified` | Target handles unified addresses and receiver selection | Address semantics affect pool choice and recipient leakage |
| `privacy.policy` | Artifact records allowed information leakage | zcashd exposes privacy-policy choices during transaction construction |
| `test.zcashd` | Validation uses zcashd RPC or a compatible local library | Target validation depends on Zcash tooling, not Bitcoin Core alone |

Zcash should reuse existing UTXO candidate ids for transparent flows where the
semantics match, including `storage.utxo`, `tx.builder`,
`signature.checksig`, and `fee.weight`. The existing `zk.circuit` capability is
not the right first abstraction for ordinary Zcash shielded transfers; it only
fits future auxiliary proof-program work outside the Zcash consensus proof
system.

### Bitcoin Cash CashScript

See [Bitcoin Cash CashScript target](targets/bitcoin-cash-cashscript.md).

BCH/CashScript overlaps with UTXO covenant targets, but its CashVM,
transaction-introspection, CashTokens, and transaction-builder semantics need
explicit representation before a target profile is added.

| Candidate id | Portable meaning | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| `storage.utxo` | State and value live in spendable UTXOs | Not account/object storage or global contract state |
| `script.p2sh` | Contract deployment/addressing uses P2SH locking scripts | Deployment/address surface is target-native |
| `script.unlocker` | Contract calls are unlocking scripts for selected UTXOs | Not ordinary method dispatch |
| `tx.introspection` | Contract reads current transaction inputs/outputs and active input data | Core covenant mechanism in BCH CashVM |
| `covenant.introspection` | Contract constrains successor outputs through introspection | Needed for covenant-style state transitions |
| `storage.local_state` | Local state is simulated through script data or CashTokens commitments | Not persistent global storage |
| `asset.cashtoken` | Contract handles CashTokens category, capability, NFT commitment, and token amount | Native asset model differs from generic `value.native` |
| `timelock.locktime` | Contract depends on locktime, sequence, or age checks | Separate from ordinary block reads |
| `signature.checksig` | Contract verifies signatures as spend conditions | UTXO spend authorization is script-level |
| `artifact.cashscript` | Build emits a CashScript artifact JSON and bytecode metadata | Target tooling requirement |
| `tx.builder` | Validation includes building and evaluating a spend transaction | Practical target semantics require transaction construction |
