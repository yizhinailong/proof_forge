## Decision Log

| ID | Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | 2026-06-30 | RFC 0001 and RFC 0002 are **Accepted** as the engineering direction | Detailed target and backlog docs exist; Draft status was misleading |
| D-002 | 2026-06-30 | Phase 1 (target registry + portable IR + artifact metadata) must complete before non-EVM spikes | Spikes need capability checks and shared scenario definitions |
| D-003 | 2026-06-30 | CosmWasm and Solana spikes run **in parallel** after Phase 1 | No fixed order between the two; both validate different backend families |
| D-004 | 2026-06-30 | ~~Canonical Solana target id is `solana-sbpf-linker`~~ **Superseded by D-026** | Stock Zig + sbpf-linker fitted platform tooling; `solana-sbf` is a filename alias only. D-026 supersedes this with `solana-sbpf-asm` as the preferred direct-assembly route. |
| D-005 | 2026-06-30 | Keep **`solana-zig-fork`** as fallback/reference track | Mature SDK reference from solana-sdk-mono; not the primary product path |
| D-006 | 2026-06-30 | NEAR is the Wasm-host **reference**; CosmWasm is the first new Wasm spike in-repo | Fork lessons inform structure; CosmWasm validates host adapter generality |
| D-007 | 2026-06-30 | Move POC starts with **Aptos only**; Sui follows | Aptos account resources are simpler; Sui object model tests abstraction harder |
| D-008 | 2026-06-30 | Move targets use **source generation**, not Lean runtime on MoveVM | Proofs stay in Lean; Move carries executable logic only |
| D-009 | 2026-06-30 | **`wasm-polkadot` / ink!** stays research-only | Not in the target registry until a spike is scheduled |
| D-010 | 2026-06-30 | Cloud platform waits until **two or more targets** reach Experimental stage | Avoid building a UI shell before local backends are real |
| D-011 | 2026-06-30 | Add **`psy-dpn`** as a Research target under ZK circuit source generation | Psy has no public Yul-like IR; first integration should generate `.psy` and call Dargo |
| D-012 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`kaspa-toccata`** as a docs-first Research candidate, not a ZK circuit sourcegen target | Toccata is Kaspa L1 programmability through transaction v1, covenants, inline proof verification, and based-app settlement; code registry changes wait until UTXO/covenant capabilities are reviewed |
| D-013 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`wasm-stellar-soroban`** as a docs-first Wasm-host Research candidate | Soroban emits Wasm but has Stellar-specific storage TTL, authorization, contract spec, deployment, and CLI semantics; registry changes wait until the first spike path is chosen |
| D-014 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`wasm-icp-canister`** as a docs-first Wasm-host Research candidate | Internet Computer canisters emit Wasm but have Candid, principal identity, update/query call modes, cycles, stable memory, async inter-canister calls, and lifecycle semantics; registry changes wait until a canister spike path is chosen |
| D-015 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`ton-tvm`** as a docs-first TVM/Tolk sourcegen Research candidate | TON contracts target TVM with cells, TL-B serialization, message handlers, get methods, action lists, account lifecycle, and TVM gas semantics; registry changes wait until a sourcegen spike path is chosen |
| D-016 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`bch-cashscript`** as a docs-first UTXO script/covenant sourcegen Research candidate | Bitcoin Cash contracts through CashScript lock and spend UTXOs with BCH Script, transaction introspection, CashTokens, and SDK transaction-builder semantics; registry changes wait until a CashScript spike path is chosen |
| D-017 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`algorand-avm`** as a docs-first AVM/TEAL sourcegen Research candidate | Algorand contracts target AVM approval/clear-state or LogicSig programs with ARC-4 ABI, global/local/box storage, resource references, atomic transaction groups, inner transactions, and AVM budget semantics; registry changes wait until an Algorand package spike path is chosen |
| D-018 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`cardano-plutus-aiken`** as a docs-first eUTXO validator sourcegen Research candidate | Cardano contracts validate eUTXO spends through datum, redeemer, script context, Plutus/UPLC artifacts, execution units, Plutus blueprints, and off-chain transaction-building semantics; registry changes wait until an Aiken sourcegen spike path is chosen |
| D-019 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`tezos-michelson-ligo`** as a docs-first Michelson/LIGO sourcegen Research candidate | Tezos contracts target Michelson with typed storage, parameters, entrypoints, views/events, operation lists, `big_map`, tickets, Sapling, gas, and storage-burn semantics; registry changes wait until a LIGO sourcegen spike path is chosen |
| D-020 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`starknet-cairo`** as a docs-first Cairo/Sierra/CASM sourcegen Research candidate | Starknet contracts compile through Cairo into Sierra/CASM with ABI, class hashes, declaration/deployment metadata, Starknet storage/events, account abstraction, syscalls, and L1/L2 messaging semantics; registry changes wait until a Cairo package spike path is chosen |
| D-021 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`bitcoin-script-miniscript`** as a docs-first Bitcoin base-layer spending-policy Research candidate | Bitcoin Script is intentionally limited to UTXO locking/unlocking policy with signatures, hash locks, timelocks, descriptors, Miniscript, Taproot/Tapscript, PSBT flows, and standardness/fee constraints; registry changes wait until a Miniscript/descriptor spike path is chosen |
| D-022 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`zcash-shielded`** as a docs-first privacy UTXO/ZK payment Research candidate | Zcash is Bitcoin-derived but shielded support depends on Sapling/Orchard notes, nullifiers, anchors, value-balance constraints, viewing/disclosure policy, and protocol-defined ZK proofs; registry changes wait until shielded-note capabilities and a proving/validation boundary are reviewed |
| D-023 | 2026-07-01 | Classify **`aleo-leo`** as a docs-first Aleo ZK application sourcegen Research candidate | Aleo programs combine private off-chain proof execution, public on-chain finalization, encrypted records, public mappings/storage, Aleo Instructions, Aleo VM bytecode, ABI, prover/verifier artifacts, and execute/deploy transactions; registry changes wait until the proof/finalization split is reviewed |
| D-024 | 2026-07-01 | Model Robinhood Chain as **`robinhood-chain-testnet`**, an EVM-compatible chain profile under `evm`, not a new compiler target | Robinhood Chain executes EVM-compatible Arbitrum Orbit L2 contracts; ProofForge's EVM backend covers bytecode generation, while the chain profile records chain id, RPC, explorer, verifier, rollup, and deployment metadata |
| D-025 | 2026-07-01 | Add **`solana-sbpf-asm`** as a new Solana route (direct sBPF assembly codegen) under exploration; keep `solana-sbpf-linker` as fallback | Generating sBPF assembly directly from the portable IR avoids the full Lean Zig runtime linking risk; the blueshift-gg/sbpf toolchain handles assembly and linking. See [RFC 0005](rfcs/0005-solana-sbpf-assembly-backend.md) and [design doc](targets/solana-sbpf-asm.md). |
| D-026 | 2026-07-01 | **Adopt `solana-sbpf-asm` as the canonical Solana route; supersede `solana-sbpf-linker`** | The direct-assembly route avoids Lean runtime linking risk, gives full control over compute units and stack, and mirrors the EVM/Yul pattern. `solana-sbpf-linker` is kept as historical reference only — codegen should target the assembly route. |
| D-027 | 2026-07-01 | **CPI and PDA effects stay in a Solana‑specific layer, not the portable IR** | `cpiInvoke`, `cpiInvokeSigned`, and `pdaDerive` are Solana‑only concepts (Solana's account‑passing CPI + PDA derivation have no analog on EVM, Wasm, or Move). They belong in `ProofForge.Backend.Solana.Effects` or the Solana SDK module, gated by the `crosscall.cpi` and `storage.pda` capabilities. The portable IR (`ProofForge.IR.Contract.Effect`) remains chain‑neutral — new constructors only when ≥2 target families share the same semantic shape. |
| D-028 | 2026-07-02 | **User contracts target a chain-neutral Contract Intent API; the selected target resolves intents into capability plans** | The default SDK surface should not reveal the destination chain. Users write portable contract intents, then `--target` selects the target adapter, which routes those intents to lower-level capability implementations, checks support/runtime constraints, and emits target artifacts. Capability ids remain the internal protocol used by target adapters and Target Extension SDKs; they are not the primary user-facing API. |
| D-029 | 2026-07-01 | Adopt Rust `near-sdk-rs` source generation as the in-repo `wasm-near` v0 backend | The EmitZig/Zig host bridge sources are not present in the repository; portable IR → near-sdk-rs package → cargo wasm32 validates NEAR semantics now and preserves the Zig host-bridge path for restoration later. (Renumbered from the NEAR branch's D-025 during the 2026-07 branch consolidation merge.) |
| D-030 | 2026-07-01 | `wasm-near` v0 supports `Hash` map keys, `.assertions.check`, and `.account.explicit` | Required by existing `MapProbe` (Hash keys, `assertEq`) and `ContextProbe` (`contractId`) fixtures; `.crosscall.invoke` remains unsupported for sourcegen v0. (Renumbered from the NEAR branch's D-026.) |
| D-031 | 2026-07-01 | Adopt **`EmitWat`** (portable IR → Wasm AST → WAT text → `wat2wasm`) as the canonical Wasm-family backend; demote the Rust `near-sdk-rs` sourcegen to a **frozen v0 stopgap** | `EmitWat` mirrors the in-repo **portable-IR → Yul** renderer `Backend/Evm/IR.lean` (used by every `--emit-*-ir-yul` CLI mode), *not* the separate LCNF-based `Compiler/LCNF/EmitYul.lean`. Because the portable IR already abstracts over Lean objects (`u32`/`u64`/`bool`/`hash` scalars + storage effects only), `EmitWat` needs no Lean runtime port, object-model boxing, or GC — avoiding both the `near-sdk` macro coupling of the Rust route (E0119 Borsh / missing-`&self` cargo-check failures) and the Lean-runtime-to-Wasm port that blocks the prior `EmitZig` plan. Shared layer: `Compiler/Wasm/AST.lean` + `Printer.lean` + IR→AST lowering (parallel to `Compiler/Yul/AST.lean` + `Printer.lean`); reusable validation from `Backend/WasmNear/IR.lean` and `Backend/Evm/IR.lean`. Per-chain: host imports + ABI serialization. Key spike risk: NEAR argument (de)serialization (JSON/Borsh), which the EVM backend does not face (EVM uses calldata). (Renumbered from the NEAR branch's D-027.) |
| D-032 | 2026-07-01 | Ratify **`aleo-leo`** Research exit design: Leo-first `zk-app-sourcegen` boundary, canonical capabilities for Road 1, artifact manifest schema, and `leo build`/`leo test` toolchain | Aleo's proof/finalization split requires its own sourcegen family distinct from `psy-dpn`-style circuit sourcegen; code registry changes remain deferred until the Road 1 spike succeeds and is reviewed. (Renumbered from the Aleo branch's D-025 during the 2026-07 branch consolidation merge.) |
| D-033 | 2026-07-01 | Add **`wasm-cloudflare-workers`** as a Research Wasm-host target | Cloudflare Workers is not a blockchain, but it shares the Wasm-host backend pattern with NEAR/CosmWasm; it validates the portable-core model by running the same verified business logic off-chain with reinterpreted capabilities. (Renumbered from the Cloudflare branch's D-025 during the 2026-07 branch consolidation merge.) |
| D-034 | 2026-07-02 | Adopt the **tiered target portfolio** ([target-roadmap](target-roadmap.md)) and classify UTXO script targets as a separate **policy family** | Tier gates: shared-scenario parity on `evm`/`solana-sbpf-asm`/`wasm-near` opens `wasm-cosmwasm` (D-006) and `move-aptos` (D-007) in parallel; Soroban/Sui/sourcegen targets open on those exits; at most one sourcegen spike active at a time. Bitcoin-family targets (`bitcoin-script-miniscript`, `bch-cashscript`, `zcash-shielded`, `kaspa-toccata`) are spending-policy generators, not contract executors: they get a policy IR (predicate tree; no storage/events/crosscall) with new `policy.*` capability ids and a PSBT/regtest validation lane, instead of being forced through the contract pipeline |
| D-035 | 2026-07-02 | **Current phase completion criterion:** shared scenario (Counter, then ValueVault) must pass on `evm`, `solana-sbpf-asm`, and `wasm-near` before opening Tier-1 targets | Locks the Definition of Done for the current consolidation phase; keeps new research targets docs-only until Gate G0 is met, preventing premature registry/capability churn |
| D-036 | 2026-07-02 | **Unify allocator modeling** at the IR/Target layer under one `AllocatorModel` (strategy/region/release), keep Solana `solana.allocator.*` metadata keys as the Solana-specific configuration syntax, and give EVM an explicit bump-over-scratch binding | Resolves the Workstream 24 allocator-unification open question; RFC 0008 defines the triple. Persistent-state models (EVM storage, Solana accounts, NEAR storage) stay outside the allocator abstraction. `Statement.release` remains rejected on EVM until ownership soundness (FV-3) justifies a checked no-op |
| D-037 | 2026-07-02 | Keep **`wasm-cloudflare-workers`** under the `wasmHost` target family as a Research off-chain host | It shares the Wasm-host backend pattern (EmitWat, portable-core + host-bridge) with NEAR/CosmWasm; its off-chain status is expressed by stage (Research) and capability set rather than by a separate family. A distinct off-chain host family is deferred until more off-chain targets force a new classification |

## Target Family Classification

| Family | Targets | Backend pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Direct compiler | `evm` | ContractSpec / portable IR → EVM semantic plan → Yul AST/source → solc; the older Lean → LCNF → Yul path is research/equivalence only |
| EVM-compatible chain profiles | `robinhood-chain-testnet` | Reuse `evm` bytecode/ABI output; add chain id, RPC, explorer, verifier, rollup, and deployment metadata |

| Privacy UTXO ZK payment research | `zcash-shielded` (candidate, docs only) | Portable IR → shielded transaction/proving manifest → Zcash transaction with Sapling/Orchard proof bundle + zcashd/library validation metadata |
| UTXO script sourcegen research | `bch-cashscript` (candidate, docs only) | Portable IR → CashScript `.cash` source → cashc artifact JSON + BCH transaction-builder validation |
| ZK circuit sourcegen | `psy-dpn` | Portable IR → `.psy` package → Dargo → DPN circuit JSON |

## Superseded Positions

These earlier doc positions are no longer authoritative:

- RFC 0001 Phase 2 = Solana only, Phase 3 = Wasm only — replaced by parallel Phase 2 spikes (D-003).
- Milestone 3 = Solana as the single second target — replaced by parallel CosmWasm + Solana (D-003).
- CLI id `solana-sbf` — use `solana-sbpf-asm` (D-026).
- Move POC generates both Sui and Aptos packages at once — Aptos first (D-007).
