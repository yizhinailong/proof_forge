# Formal Verification Roadmap

Status: **Draft (post-consolidation, 2026-07)**

ProofForge is Lean-first, but most of today's assurance comes from tests and
golden files rather than theorems. This page records where formal verification
can be added, what already exists after the 2026-07 branch consolidation, and
which proofs pay for themselves first. Tasks are tracked in
[implementation-backlog.md](implementation-backlog.md) (Workstream 25).

## What already exists

The NEAR work contributed the first three formal anchors, now on `main`:

| Anchor | Module | What it gives us |
|---|---|---|
| Executable IR semantics (scalar + first aggregate/storage/control-flow/event slice) | `ProofForge/IR/Semantics.lean` | A small executable trace interpreter for scalar values plus fixed arrays, structs, storage arrays, storage struct fields, storage paths, aggregate ABI params/returns, `ifElse`, `boundedFor`, and observable event-log items; used by the NEAR trace obligations and the first FV-2 aggregate/storage/control-flow/event checks |
| Ownership rules | `ProofForge/IR/Ownership.lean`, `Tests/IROwnership.lean` | Checker for `release`/owned-local discipline (no use-after-release, branch consistency), currently validated by tests |
| Backend trace obligations | `ProofForge/Backend/WasmNear/Refinement.lean`, `ProofForge/Backend/Evm/Refinement.lean`, `ProofForge/Backend/Evm/YulSemantics.lean`, `Tests/NearWasmFormal.lean` | `TraceObligation` with `decide`-checked theorems: the Counter, ValueVault, EvmExpressionProbe, EvmMapProbe, EvmTypedStorageProbe, EvmStorageStructProbe, EvmAbiAggregateProbe, ConditionalProbe, EvmLoopProbe, and EventProbe IR traces match expected observable values where IR semantics exists, EmitWat exports cover the NEAR trace entrypoints, the NEAR Counter and ValueVault artifact-surface obligations pin emitted Wasm AST host-boundary calls before WAT printing, the NEAR offline-host execution-surface obligations pin Borsh input bytes plus deterministic host return fragments for Counter and ValueVault, the EVM Yul surface contains selector-dispatched functions for the same traces, and the focused emitted Yul subset executes scalar, map, typed-array storage, storage-struct, aggregate ABI, control-flow, and event-log traces to the same observable return/log words |

These are the right shape: small executable definitions plus decidable
theorems, checked in CI without external tools.

## Verification targets, in priority order

### FV-1: Capability routing soundness (small, high value)

`ProofForge.Target.requireCapabilities` and `resolveSpec` are the platform's
core promise: *a contract that routes to a target only uses capabilities that
target supports*. Today this is a runtime check exercised by tests.

Prove, for the checked boundary:

- **Soundness:** if `resolveSpec profile spec = .ok plan`, then every
  capability in `plan.calls` is in `profile.capabilities`.
- **Completeness of rejection:** if the spec references a capability outside
  the profile, `resolveSpec` returns `.error`.
- **Target-extension isolation:** if any call carries `solana.*` metadata and
  the profile family is not `.solana`, resolution fails (D-027 enforced by
  theorem, not convention).

These are structural inductions over arrays; no semantics needed. They turn
the "reject rather than silently change semantics" principle (RFC 0001) into
a machine-checked invariant.

### FV-2: IR semantics coverage and metatheory

Extend `IR/Semantics.lean` from the scalar subset toward the checked IR
surface. The first aggregate/storage slices are now in place for local fixed
arrays, struct values, aggregate ABI params/returns, storage arrays, storage
struct fields, storage paths (including nested map-key paths), and
state-threaded effectful expressions for storage map insert/set lifecycles,
`ifElse`, `boundedFor`, and observable event-log trace items, through
`decide`-checked traces in `Tests/NearWasmFormal.lean`. The first FV-2
metatheory anchors also state deterministic interpreter results and the
decreasing measure used by `boundedFor`. The next FV-2 work is to state:

- **Progress/preservation for the typed subset:** statements that pass the
  existing shape/type validation do not get stuck and preserve binding types.
- **Bounded termination completion:** the current decreasing-measure anchor
  should grow into a theorem over the release-aware, validated statement
  subset once FV-3 introduces that semantics.

This is the foundation everything else refines against. Keep it executable
(`decide`-friendly) so CI checks stay cheap.

### FV-3: Ownership/release soundness (connect FV-2 to `IR/Ownership.lean`)

The ownership checker currently passes 6 behavioral test cases. Once FV-2
gives release-aware semantics, prove: programs accepted by the ownership
checker never evaluate a released local and never release twice. This is the
formal justification for lowering `release` to allocator frees in EmitWat
while EVM/Psy reject it and TS ignores it — three different lowerings of one
IR construct are only safe if the IR-level discipline is proven.

### FV-4: Backend refinement obligations, one scenario at a time

Replicate the `TraceObligation` pattern per backend against the shared
scenario (Counter first, ValueVault second):

| Backend | Obligation shape | Feasibility |
|---|---|---|
| `wasm-near` / EmitWat | Exists (exports + IR trace) and now has Counter + ValueVault artifact-surface obligations over the emitted Wasm AST: required NEAR host imports, entrypoint/helper call sequences, memory export, storage-key data, and ValueVault event data are checked before WAT printing. It also has Counter + ValueVault offline-host execution-surface obligations: the same IR trace boundary derives the Borsh/little-endian input bytes and deterministic host return fragments that `runtime/offline-host` must print when executing the generated WAT. Extend this toward a richer Wasm/offline-host semantics boundary | High — offline host already executes the artifact deterministically |
| `evm` (IR → Yul plan) | Counter, ValueVault, and EvmExpressionProbe obligations exist for IR trace + selector-dispatched Yul surface + executable Yul-subset trace (`calldataload`, `calldatasize`, `sstore`, `sload`, scalar arithmetic, `exp`, bitwise/shift operators, comparisons, casts, assertions, `number`, deterministic memory-sensitive `keccak256` surrogate, `log0`-`log4`, `mstore`, `return`, focused `switch`, and bounded `for`). The covered FV-2 aggregate/storage, map lifecycle, control-flow, and event-log traces are now wired into the EVM obligations for `EvmMapProbe`, `EvmTypedStorageProbe`, `EvmStorageStructProbe`, `EvmAbiAggregateProbe`, `ConditionalProbe`, `EvmLoopProbe`, and `EventProbe`, so maps, presence slots, typed storage arrays, storage structs, aggregate ABI params/returns, if/else branches, bounded loops, early returns, ValueVault business events, signature-derived `topic0`, scalar indexed events, aggregate event data, and hashed aggregate indexed topics are checked on both the IR trace and executable emitted-Yul sides. | Medium — the focused Yul-subset interpreter is in Lean; expanding coverage keeps `solc` out of the trusted path but not out of the build |
| `psy-dpn` | Compare `dargo execute` result vectors against IR trace outputs (differential gate, not a theorem) | Already close: smoke scripts assert `result_vm` values today |
| `solana-sbpf-asm` | Differential testing via Mollusk/Surfpool first; assembly-level semantics is a research track, not a near-term proof | Low for proofs, high for differential gates |
| `wasm-cloudflare-workers` | Differential HTTP-level gate only (off-chain host, D-033) | Not a proof target |

Rule of thumb: a backend earns "Experimental → Supported" only with (a) the
scenario differential gate and (b) at least the export/trace obligation
theorem, mirroring what `wasm-near` already has.

### FV-5: Checked arithmetic semantics per target

The SDK's checked operators (`+!`, `-!`, `*!`, `/!`) must mean the same thing
on a 256-bit EVM word, a 64-bit Wasm integer, and a field element in Psy.
State the intended semantics once in FV-2's value domain (trap on overflow /
division-by-zero as trace outcomes), then make each backend's lowering
obligation include the overflow branch. The EVM and Psy diagnostic suites
already test rejection paths; the theorems pin down accepted-path behavior.

### FV-6: Lowering equivalence for the two authoring surfaces

`contract_source` (Lean SDK) and the legacy `.learn` parser both lower to
`ContractSpec`. Today equivalence is enforced by paired fixtures. For the
covered subset, prove that parsing a `.learn` fixture and elaborating the
matching `contract_source` block produce equal `ContractSpec` values
(decidable equality already derives). This keeps the "Learn is frozen
compatibility, not a second language" policy honest, and makes drift a build
failure instead of a review judgment.

### FV-7: Token SDK plan invariants

`TokenSpec.planForTarget` invariants worth stating as theorems:

- Feature routing is total: every accepted feature set yields a plan or a
  planner diagnostic (no silent drops).
- Documented incompatibilities (e.g. `transfer_fee` + `non_transferable`)
  always produce the diagnostic.
- Solana plans reference only program ids and accounts declared in the plan
  itself (well-formedness of the emitted instruction sequence).

### FV-8: User-level contract invariants (product direction)

The long-term differentiator: let contract authors state invariants next to
`contract_source` (e.g. `balance = deposits - releases + fees` for
ValueVault) and prove them against the FV-2 semantics before codegen. This
needs no backend work — it is pure Lean over the IR semantics — and is the
first proof surface users see. Start with ValueVault as the worked example.

## Non-goals

- No proofs about `solc`, `wat2wasm`, `sbpf`, `leo`, or chain runtimes; those
  stay in the differential-testing trust boundary and are recorded per gate
  in [validation-gates.md](validation-gates.md).
- No proof-transport to chains (no on-chain verification of Lean proofs);
  proofs gate codegen, per RFC 0001.
- No attempt to verify the Lean elaborator or Lake; the trusted computing
  base is stated, not eliminated.

## Suggested sequencing

1. FV-1 capability soundness (structural, unblocks nothing, high trust value).
2. FV-2 semantics extension + determinism (foundation).
3. FV-3 ownership soundness (justifies the merged `release` lowerings).
4. FV-4 backend trace obligations: scalar EVM IR traces are done for
   Counter, ValueVault, and EvmExpressionProbe; FV-2 map/aggregate/storage,
   control-flow, and event-log IR traces are now also connected to the EVM map,
   typed-storage, storage-struct, aggregate-ABI, conditional, loop, and event
   obligations. NEAR now has Counter and ValueVault EmitWat artifact-surface
   obligations plus offline-host execution-surface obligations; next, deepen
   that boundary toward richer Wasm/offline-host semantics.
5. FV-6 authoring-surface equivalence for the fixture subset.
6. FV-5 / FV-7 as the respective surfaces stabilize; FV-8 once FV-2 lands.
