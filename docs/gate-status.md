# Gate Completion Records

Status: **Live (2026-07-04)**

This page is the authoritative per-gate completion ledger for the tiered
portfolio ([target-roadmap](target-roadmap.md), D-034). Each Gate has one
record listing its acceptance criteria, per-criterion status, evidence, and
sign-off date. A Gate is **closed** only when every criterion is **met**; a
single unmet criterion blocks the next tier. Gate P0 records the
primary-chain completion covenant (D-045), which is stricter than the G0
behavior/budget slice.

Unlike [development-log](development-log.md) (a stream of engineering
milestones), this page records the *phase boundary* decisions: whether the
current phase's Definition of Done is satisfied, with auditable evidence.

## How to use

- Add a new `## Gate GN` section when a Gate's first criterion starts.
- Update status to ✅ / ❌ / 🟡 (met / unmet / in-progress) as work lands.
- Record evidence as reproducible commands and commit ranges, not prose.
- A Gate closes with a `**Closed: YYYY-MM-DD**` line; until then it stays
  **Open**.

## Gate G0 — Tier-0 exit (current phase goal)

**Definition of Done:** the shared scenario (Counter, then ValueVault) passes
in [testkit](../testkit/) (RFC 0007) on `evm`, `solana-sbpf-asm`, and
`wasm-near` — behavior parity *and* resource budgets (D-040 / RFC 0010).

**Status: Closed**

**Closed: 2026-07-03**

### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| G0-1 | Counter behavior parity on 3 targets | ✅ met | `just testkit` → `counter trace parity: ok (3 target(s))` |
| G0-2 | ValueVault behavior parity on 3 targets | ✅ met | Remote CI `28655651561` (`12a007b`) `build-test` → `Run unified testkit` succeeded with Foundry/cast installed |
| G0-3 | Counter resource budgets: `solana_cu`, `evm_gas`, `near_gas` | ✅ met | `testkit/scenarios/counter.toml` pins all three budgets; `CAST="$PWD/build/tools/cast-shim" cargo run --manifest-path testkit/Cargo.toml -p proof-forge-testkit -- run --scenario counter --trace` |
| G0-4 | ValueVault resource budgets on 3 targets | ✅ met | `testkit/scenarios/value-vault.toml` pins `solana_cu`, `evm_gas`, and `near_gas` for all 11 calls; `CAST="$PWD/build/tools/cast-shim" cargo run --manifest-path testkit/Cargo.toml -p proof-forge-testkit -- run --scenario value-vault --trace` |
| G0-5 | Unsupported-capability diagnostic parity | ✅ met | `just testkit` → `unsupported-crosscall ... diagnostic crosscall.invoke unsupported: ok` |
| G0-6 | `just check` green (build + lint + gates) | ✅ met | `CAST="$PWD/build/tools/cast-shim" just check` passed locally; remote CI `28658576786` (`0c52fb8`) completed successfully, including `Run unified testkit`, `Check Solana light gates`, Foundry smokes, and Anvil deploy smoke |

### Carry-over work after Gate G0

Gate G0 closes the shared behavior/resource-budget slice. It does **not** close
Gate P0. The remaining primary-chain production hardening stays active:

1. ~~EVM semantic-plan migration (Workstream 3: ExprPlan/StmtPlan/
   EntrypointPlan/EventPlan/CrosscallPlan/MetadataPlan).~~ ✅ Landed — see P0-2.
2. ~~Solana Pinocchio live dual-deploy equivalence CI/toolchain hardening and
   broader reference coverage (Workstream 7).~~ ✅ Landed — see P0-1.
3. ~~NEAR/Wasm target-first local execution/deploy metadata sign-off.~~ ✅
   Landed — see P0-3.

### Sign-off

Gate G0 closed on 2026-07-03 at commit `0c52fb8` after GitHub CI run
`28658576786` completed successfully. The closing run validates the current
`just check` CI surface, including the unified testkit, Solana light gates,
EVM Foundry/Anvil gates, and the smoke jobs for the frozen non-primary spikes.

## Gate P0 — Primary-chain completion covenant (current product prerequisite)

**Definition of Done:** ProofForge must complete the three priority chains in
implementation order — `solana-sbpf-asm`, `evm` (Ethereum), and `wasm-near`
(NEAR/Wasm) — before any additional chain advances beyond docs-only research or
frozen spike maintenance (D-045).

**Status: Closed**

### Acceptance criteria

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0-1 | Solana direct sBPF backend is production-grade | ✅ met | Gate G0 behavior/budget parity is closed; Pinocchio reference-equivalence is included in `just solana-light`; the Agave/Solana CLI ELF compatibility blocker was fixed by forwarding target-first `--solana-sbpf-arch v0` into the legacy ELF builder, producing loader-compatible v0 ELFs (`e_flags = 0`, valid section table) from `emit --target solana-sbpf-asm --format elf`; local `just solana-pinocchio-live-equivalence` passes all five Surfpool dual-deploy scenarios (System transfer/create_account, SPL Token transfer/ops/authority) with `5 passed, 0 skipped, 0 failed`; GitHub CI run `28675037861` at commit `3b2719a` completed successfully, including the mandatory `solana-pinocchio-live` job. That job installed Agave/Solana CLI, SBF platform-tools, `sbpf`, Surfpool, Node/npm, built ProofForge, and ran the aggregate live suite without allow-skip. |
| P0-2 | Ethereum/EVM backend is production-grade | ✅ met | EVM semantic-plan migration landed (RFC 0004): `Plan.lean` now defines `ExprPlan`, `StmtPlan`, `EntrypointPlan`, `EventPlan`, `CrosscallPlan`, `MetadataPlan`; `Validate.lean` holds pure validation/type-inference; `Lower.lean` constructs the populated `ModulePlan` (entrypoints, events, crosscalls, creates, checked-arithmetic flag); `Metadata.lean` produces plan-driven artifact/deploy metadata; `IR.lean` is the compatibility facade that builds the full semantic plan before Yul generation. Gates: `just evm-plan`, `just evm-semantic-plan`, `just evm-all` (diagnostics 58 cases, 99 IR coverage entries, 19 IR smokes + Foundry + Anvil deploy), `just check` all green. FV-4 additionally includes decide-checked executable EVM/Yul trace obligations for Counter, ValueVault, EvmExpressionProbe, EvmMapProbe, EvmTypedStorageProbe, EvmStorageStructProbe, and EvmAbiAggregateProbe, covering scalar traces plus map slots, typed storage arrays, storage structs, and aggregate ABI params/returns. FV-2 now has IR aggregate/storage and map lifecycle executable trace slices for arrays, structs, storage paths, aggregate ABI values, and state-threaded map insert/set expressions; wiring those traces into the EVM obligations remains future formal-roadmap work and is not a P0-2 sign-off blocker. |
| P0-3 | NEAR/Wasm backend is production-grade | ✅ met | EmitWat/NEAR diagnostics, IR coverage, formal anchors, offline host smoke, and budget baselines are green. Commit `466b320` adds target-first `check`, `emit`, and `build` coverage for `wasm-near`, writes `proof-forge-artifact.json` plus `proof-forge-deploy.json`, validates WAT/optional Wasm hashes, ABI entrypoints, capabilities, fixture/module ids, and local offline-host deployment mode with `scripts/near/validate-emitwat-metadata.py`, and executes the generated Counter WAT through `runtime/offline-host`. Evidence: local `just near-target-first` and `just check`; GitHub CI run `28677055773` at commit `466b320` completed successfully, including `Run Wasm-NEAR target-first smoke`, `Run EmitWat offline host smoke`, `Run unified testkit`, Foundry/Anvil, and the mandatory `solana-pinocchio-live` job. |
| P0-4 | Additional-chain advancement stayed frozen through P0 | ✅ met | D-044/D-045 froze Aptos/CosmWasm advancement past M1/M2 and kept other targets docs-first until P0 closed. After closure, Tier-1 work is eligible for scheduling, but the backlog puts CLI M3/M4 cleanup first. |

### Sign-off

Gate P0 closed on 2026-07-04 at commit `466b320` after GitHub CI run
`28677055773` completed successfully. The closing run adds the missing
NEAR/Wasm target-first local execution/deploy metadata evidence and revalidates
the existing Solana, EVM, frozen-spike, and shared testkit gates.

## Gate G1a — CosmWasm M4 (not started)

**Status: Not started.** Gate P0 is closed, so the D-045 freeze no longer
blocks scheduling. The next implementation step is still controlled by the
backlog: finish the CLI M3/M4 target-first migration before advancing this
spike to M3/M4.

## Gate G1b — Aptos M4 (not started)

**Status: Not started.** Gate P0 is closed, so the D-045 freeze no longer
blocks scheduling. The next implementation step is still controlled by the
backlog: finish the CLI M3/M4 target-first migration before advancing this
spike to M3/M4 or starting `move-sui`.

## Gate G2 — both Tier-1 exits (not started)

**Status: Not started.** Opens only after G1a *and* G1b close.
