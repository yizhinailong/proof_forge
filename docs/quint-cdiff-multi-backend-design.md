# Quint C-diff multi-backend — feasibility assessment and design

Status: **Draft (research + design; multi-module C-diff shims landed for EVM, NEAR, and Solana)**

Date: 2026-07-07

Target phase: [RFC 0014](rfcs/0014-unified-semantic-lowering-contract.md) Phase 5, Path 5a
(Tier C-diff cross-backend rollout).

Companion documents:

- [RFC 0014](rfcs/0014-unified-semantic-lowering-contract.md) — the unified lowering contract;
  Tier C-diff is defined in the "Four tiers" table and Phase 5.
- [multi-backend-moduleplan-design.md](multi-backend-moduleplan-design.md) — the Tier B
  per-backend `*ModulePlan` audit (Phase 4), whose `*ModulePlan` artifacts are the
  prerequisite for stable C-diff replay.
- [shared-diagnostic-design.md](shared-diagnostic-design.md) — shared `LoweringDiagnostic`.

## 1. Purpose

RFC 0014 Tier C-diff is **differential trace replay**: the Quint MBT backend generates
ITF traces from the portable IR's formal semantics (`ProofForge.IR.Semantics`), and
those traces are replayed against each backend's *actual emitted artifact*
(bytecode/ELF/WAT/Move bytecode), comparing observable behavior. This catches divergence
between the IR's formal semantics and what the backend actually emits — a pragmatic
substitute for a full target-chain formal semantics (Tier C-proof).

Today C-diff covers **EVM** (`just quint-evm-backend-replay-gate`,
`Tests/Quint/CounterEvmReplay.lean`, `ProofForge.Backend.Quint.EvmReplay.lean`), plus
additive type-only stubs for **NEAR** (`NearReplay.lean`) and **Solana**
(`SolanaReplay.lean`). This document audits every other backend for C-diff
feasibility, picks the easiest next candidate, specifies the abstract replay
interface and the field-level design for the chosen candidate's replay shim,
and records what is deferred and why.

This is a **research + design** step. The only implementation artifact (optional,
additive) is a type-only `NearReplay.lean` stub that does not touch any existing replay
behavior or golden trace (see §7).

## 2. What Quint C-diff is today (the EVM reference)

### 2.1 The pipeline

The current EVM C-diff pipeline (`scripts/quint/evm-backend-replay-gate.sh` →
`Tests/Quint/CounterEvmReplay.lean`) is:

```text
IR.Semantics-derivable Quint model (.qnt)
  -- ProofForge.Backend.Quint.Lower.renderModule : IR.Module -> Scenario.Config -> String
  -> quint run --mbt --out-itf=<itf.json>          -- Quint generates ITF traces
  -> ITF.Trace                                       -- ProofForge.Backend.Quint.ITF.parse
  -> EvmReplay.renderFoundryTest                     -- Lean lowers the trace to a Foundry test
  -> forge test                                      -- Foundry executes against etched bytecode
  -> PASS/FAIL
```

The same ITF trace is *also* replayed through `ProofForge.IR.Semantics` directly
(`Tests/Quint/CounterReplay.lean` → `Replay.replayTrace`) — that is **Tier A** (IR
semantics self-replay). The EVM backend replay is **Tier C-diff**: the same trace is
replayed against the *real EVM artifact* (runtime bytecode etched via `vm.etch`,
executed by Foundry's EVM).

### 2.2 The replay interface — what `EvmReplay` provides

`ProofForge.Backend.Quint.EvmReplay.lean` does **not** execute the artifact itself. It
is a **trace → test-source renderer**: it lowers the ITF trace into a Solidity/Foundry
test that, when compiled and run by `forge`, replays the trace against the etched
bytecode. The observable comparison is "the contract's `get()` return value equals the
ITF-expected value after each step".

The shape is:

```lean
structure EvmReplayConfig where
  bytecodeHex : String           -- the emitted runtime bytecode (hex)
  contractAddress : String        -- where to etch it
  readSignature : String          -- Solidity getter used to read primary state
  primaryStateVar : String        -- ITF/IR state variable name being checked

def renderFoundryTest (irModule : IR.Module) (trace : ITF.Trace)
    (cfg : EvmReplayConfig) : Except EvmReplayError String
```

Key properties of the EVM shim:

1. **Trace-side (Lean):** pure functions over `IR.Module` + `ITF.Trace` that emit a
   target-specific test harness as a string. Reuses `Replay.resolveActionName`,
   `Replay.entrypointMap`, `Replay.buildArgs` from the shared `Replay.lean`.
2. **Artifact-side (external):** the actual execution happens in the target's native
   toolchain (`forge`), not in Lean. The Lean side only renders the harness that drives
   it.
3. **Observation:** a single primary scalar state variable is read back via a known
   getter signature and compared to the ITF-expected value. This is a *v1* limitation
   (see `EvmReplay.renderMutatingStep` — "EVM replay v1 does not encode entrypoint
   args").
4. **Comparison:** `assertEq(readState(target), <expected>)` after each step.

### 2.3 What the shared `Replay.lean` provides (trace interpretation)

`ProofForge.Backend.Quint.Replay.lean` is the **chain-neutral** trace interpreter used
by *both* Tier A (IR replay) and the trace-side of every C-diff shim. It provides:

- `ITF.Value → IR.Semantics.Value` conversion (`itfValueToIr`), including hashes,
  addresses, options.
- `buildInitialState : IR.Module → ITF.State → Except ReplayError State` — projects an
  ITF state into IR storage.
- `resolveActionName : IR.Module → Option String → List (String × ITF.Value) → Except
  ReplayError String` — maps `mbt::actionTaken` + nondet picks to an entrypoint name.
- `buildArgs : Entrypoint → List (String × ITF.Value) → Except ReplayError (Array
  IR.Semantics.Value)` — converts nondet picks to IR argument values.
- `entrypointMap : IR.Module → HashMap String Entrypoint` — sanitized-name lookup.
- `compareStates : State → State → Except ReplayError Unit` — full storage comparison.

A `*Replay` backend shim reuses all of these; it only adds the **artifact-side**
rendering (how to call the compiled artifact and how to read back the observable
state).

### 2.4 The Rust harness side

`testkit/harness-quint/src/lib.rs` (`run_mbt`) is the testkit driver: it checks `quint`
is available, builds `ProofForge.Backend.Quint.Replay`, then runs a Lean replay test
(`lake env lean --run <replay_test>`) and scans its stdout for `PASS` (or configured
needles). It is agnostic to which backend the replay test targets — it just runs the
named Lean file. So a new `*Replay.lean` test plugs into the same harness with a new
scenario TOML entry; no Rust changes are required to add a backend.

## 3. Audit method

For each target backend we ask:

1. **Executable artifact.** What does the backend emit that a C-diff replay could
   execute against? (bytecode/ELF/WAT/Move bytecode/Leo program/TS worker).
2. **Local execution environment.** Is there a deterministic execution environment
   available *locally* (no live network)? Foundry/Anvil for EVM, Mollusk for Solana,
   `runtime/offline-host` (wasmtime) for NEAR, `dargo execute` for Psy, `sui` CLI for
   Move-Sui, `leo` for Aleo, `wrangler`/node for Cloudflare.
3. **Replay shim shape.** What would the Lean-side `*Replay` module look like? Does it
   render a test harness (like EVM → Foundry), render a host invocation script (like
   NEAR → offline-host args), or render an in-process trace (like Mollusk)?
4. **State observation.** How is the primary state read back and compared to the ITF
   expected value? Does the artifact expose a getter, or must the shim read raw
   account/linear-memory/storage state?
5. **IR-trace → artifact-call mapping.** How cleanly do IR entrypoint calls map to
   artifact-level calls? (EVM: 1:1 via ABI selector; Solana: instruction discriminator +
   account meta + instruction data; NEAR: Wasm export + little-endian input bytes).
6. **Difficulty.** Easy / medium / hard, with evidence and blockers.

## 4. Per-backend feasibility table

| Backend | Executable artifact | Local exec env available? | Replay shim shape | IR→artifact call mapping | Difficulty | Recommended order |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EVM** ✅ | Runtime bytecode (hex) | Foundry `forge test` (etched bytecode) | Render Foundry `.t.sol`; `forge` executes | ABI selector via `abi.encodeWithSignature` | Done | — |
| **NEAR (WasmNear)** | WAT → `.wasm` (via `wat2wasm`) | `runtime/offline-host` (wasmtime, in-tree) — runs WAT exports directly, no external RPC | Render offline-host CLI args (`run <wat> <exports...> --inputs-hex <...>`); offline-host executes | Wasm export name = entrypoint name; args = little-endian bytes (matches `portable_input_bytes_le`) | **Easy** | **1st** |
| **Solana** | sBPF ELF `.so` (via `sbpf build`) | Mollusk (Rust crate, in `testkit/harness-solana`) — local sim, no network; needs `sbpf` + `solana-keygen` (installed here) | Render Rust Mollusk test file (mirrors EVM's Foundry test rendering); `cargo test` executes | Instruction discriminator (1-byte tag from manifest) + account meta + instruction-data byte stream | **Medium** | **2nd** (stub landed) |
| **Psy** | Psy module (executed by `dargo`) | `dargo execute` — **not installed here** per AGENTS.md | Render `dargo execute` invocation script | Psy entrypoint → dargo call | **Medium** (blocked on tool) | 3rd (deferred) |
| **Move-Sui** | Move source module | `sui` CLI (installed here) — but no real lowering; Counter MVP template only | n/a — no real artifact to replay against | n/a | **Hard** (no real lowering) | Deferred |
| **Aleo** | Leo program | `leo` CLI (installed here) — but research spike only | Render `leo run` invocation | Leo transition → entrypoint | **Hard** (research spike) | Deferred |
| **Cloudflare** | TS worker | `wrangler`/`node` (installed here) — but research spike only | Render worker invocation | Worker fetch handler | **Hard** (research spike) | Deferred |
| **CosmWasm** | WAT → `.wasm` | wasmtime/host (not installed) | Clone NEAR pattern | CosmWasm execute msg | **Medium** (no env) | Deferred |

**Summary:** NEAR is the clear next candidate. Its execution environment
(`runtime/offline-host`) is *in-tree*, already used by `just wasm-near-plan` and the
NEAR testkit harness, needs no external RPC, and its CLI interface is a simple
`run <wat> <export> [--inputs-hex <...>]` — the Lean shim just renders that argument
list. Solana is second (Mollusk is in-tree as a Rust dependency and the tools are
installed, but the account-model translation is more involved).

## 5. Chosen next candidate: NEAR (WasmNear)

### 5.1 Why NEAR is easiest — evidence

1. **The execution environment is in-tree.** `runtime/offline-host/` is a wasmtime-based
   host that runs a NEAR WAT module's exports directly, with deterministic inputs
   (`--inputs-hex`, `--attached-deposit`, `--block-timestamp`, etc.) and parses
   `call N:<name>: return_hex=... return_u64=...` lines from stdout. It is already used
   by `scripts/near/emitwat-ci-smoke.sh` and the NEAR testkit harness. No external RPC,
   no `wasmtime` CLI needed (it's a Cargo dependency).
2. **The CLI interface is a flat argument list.** `offline-host run <wat> <export1>
   <export2> ... --inputs-hex <hex1>,<hex2>,...` — exactly the shape a Lean string
   renderer produces. Compare with EVM, which must render a full Solidity test contract.
3. **The IR→artifact call mapping is clean.** NEAR Wasm exports are named after IR
   entrypoints (`ep.name`), and inputs are little-endian-encoded argument bytes
   (`portable_input_bytes_le` already used by the testkit). The offline-host returns
   `return_hex`/`return_u64`/`return_bool`/`return=<none>` per call, which maps to
   `IR.Semantics.Value`.
4. **The WAT artifact is already gated.** `Examples/Backend/WasmNear/Counter.golden.wat` and
   `ValueVault.golden.wat` pin byte-stable output; `just wasm-near-plan` and
   `just near-plan-smoke` gate the plan surface. The `NearModulePlan` (Phase 4 Step A)
   makes the layout inspectable. A C-diff replay consumes the *emitted WAT*, not the
   plan — but the plan is what makes the WAT stable enough for trace-level diffing.
5. **`quint` and `wat2wasm` are installed here.** The full pipeline (Quint MBT → ITF →
   Lean shim → offline-host) can run end-to-end in this environment — though the
   offline-host runs WAT directly (it compiles via wasmtime internally), so `wat2wasm`
   is not even strictly required for the replay shim.

### 5.2 What the shim does NOT do

- It does **not** execute the WAT itself (the offline-host does that).
- It does **not** change `Replay.lean`, `EvmReplay.lean`, or any existing golden trace.
- It does **not** require a live NEAR network or `near` CLI.

## 6. Abstract replay interface (generalizing from `EvmReplay`)

Generalizing the EVM shim, every C-diff `*Replay` module provides:

```lean
-- per-backend config: how to find and drive the artifact
structure <Target>ReplayConfig where
  artifactPath : String          -- path to the emitted artifact (bytecode/WAT/ELF/...)
  -- per-backend fields: how to read back primary state (getter signature,
  -- account data offset, Wasm export, ...)

-- per-backend error
structure <Target>ReplayError where
  message : String

-- Render the trace as a *target-specific harness* that, when executed by the
-- target's native toolchain, replays the trace against the artifact and compares
-- observable state. The return type is a string (a test file, a CLI arg list, a
-- script, ...).
def renderReplayHarness (irModule : IR.Module) (trace : ITF.Trace)
    (cfg : <Target>ReplayConfig) : Except <Target>ReplayError String

-- (optional) Parse the harness-execution stdout and compare to ITF expectations.
-- For EVM this is done inside the generated Foundry test (assertEq); for NEAR
-- the offline-host stdout is parsed by the testkit. Both are valid; the contract
-- is "the harness + its executor produce a PASS/FAIL signal".
```

The chain-neutral pieces (`resolveActionName`, `buildArgs`, `entrypointMap`,
`itfValueToIr`, `buildInitialState`, `compareStates`) stay in `Replay.lean` and are
imported by every shim. A shim only adds:

1. **Config** — where the artifact lives and how to observe state.
2. **`renderReplayHarness`** — lower `(IR.Module, ITF.Trace, Config)` to a string that
   drives the target toolchain.
3. **Observation** — how the harness reads back the primary state (a getter call, a
   storage read, a return-value decode) and compares it to the ITF expected value.

This is intentionally *not* a Lean typeclass: each backend's harness shape (Solidity
file vs CLI arg list vs Rust test) differs too much, and the EVM shim already shows
that a per-backend module with shared helpers is enough. A typeclass encoding is a
Phase 7 open question (inherited from RFC 0014).

## 7. Field-level design: `NearReplay`

### 7.1 Config

```lean
structure NearReplayConfig where
  watPath : String                -- path to the emitted WAT artifact
  -- The offline-host reads back state by *calling* an exported getter and decoding
  -- its return value; there is no direct linear-memory introspection in the shim.
  primaryStateExport : String     -- Wasm export used to read primary state (e.g. "get")
  primaryStateVar : String        -- ITF/IR state variable name being checked (e.g. "count")
```

This mirrors `EvmReplayConfig` (`readSignature` / `primaryStateVar`) but with a Wasm
export name instead of a Solidity signature.

### 7.2 State representation

The offline-host is stateful *across calls within one invocation* (it persists the
Wasm store between exports in the same `run` command). So a trace is replayed as a
*single* offline-host invocation with the trace's calls in order:

```text
offline-host run <wat> <export1> <export2> ... <exportN> --inputs-hex <hex1>,<hex2>,...,<hexN>
```

Each `export_i` is the trace step's entrypoint name; `hex_i` is the little-endian
encoding of that step's IR arguments (empty for nullary entrypoints). The offline-host
prints one `call i:<name>: return_hex=...` line per call; the shim (or a wrapping test)
parses these and compares `return_u64` (or `return_hex`) to the ITF-expected value.

This is simpler than EVM: EVM renders a *Solidity test file* and runs `forge`; NEAR
renders a *CLI arg list* and runs `offline-host`. Both are "render a string that drives
the target toolchain".

### 7.3 IR-level trace step → artifact-level call mapping

For each ITF state after the first:

1. `actionName ← resolveActionName module state.actionTaken state.nondetPicks`
   (shared `Replay`).
2. `entrypoint ← entrypointMap module |>.get? actionName` (shared `Replay`).
3. `args ← buildArgs entrypoint state.nondetPicks` (shared `Replay`) — `Array
   IR.Semantics.Value`.
4. `inputBytes ← encodeArgsLe args` — encode each arg as little-endian bytes
   (`IR.Semantics.Value → ByteArray`), concatenated. This is the NEAR-specific step;
   it mirrors `ScenarioStep.portable_input_bytes_le` in the testkit core.
5. The rendered call is just `actionName` (the export name) with its hex appended to
   the `--inputs-hex` comma-list.

The `init` action is special-cased: NEAR's `initialize` is a normal export (unlike
EVM's `initialize()` which must reset state); the offline-host persists state across
calls, so `init` just runs first and sets the primary state to 0.

### 7.4 Observation and comparison

Two options, in increasing fidelity:

- **v1 (single-scalar, mirrors EVM v1):** after each mutating step, append a
  `primaryStateExport` call (e.g. `get`) to the export list with no inputs, and compare
  the offline-host's `return_u64` for that call to the ITF-expected value of
  `primaryStateVar`. This is exactly the EVM v1 shape (read-back-after-each-step) and
  is the recommended first cut.
- **v2 (full state diff):** parse the offline-host's full call log and compare every
  state variable. Deferred — requires the offline-host to expose storage state, which
  it does not today (it only returns call outputs).

v1 is the design in this document. It is tractable, additive, and mirrors the EVM
shim's proven shape.

### 7.5 Rendering shape

```lean
def renderOfflineHostArgs (irModule : IR.Module) (trace : ITF.Trace)
    (cfg : NearReplayConfig) : Except NearReplayError String := do
  -- produces a single string: "run <wat> <export1> <export2> ... --inputs-hex <...>"
  -- with a trailing getter call after each mutating step (v1)
```

The wrapping Lean test (`Tests/Quint/CounterNearReplay.lean`, future) would:

1. emit the Quint model, run `quint run --mbt --out-itf`;
2. emit the WAT (`Tests/EmitWatSmoke.lean` path or `proof-forge emit --target
   wasm-near`);
3. call `NearReplay.renderOfflineHostArgs` to get the arg list;
4. spawn `cargo run --manifest-path runtime/offline-host/Cargo.toml -- <args>`;
5. parse stdout and compare each read-back call's `return_u64` to the ITF expected
   value;
6. print `PASS`/`FAIL`.

### 7.6 What is NOT in the stub (this step)

The stub delivered here (§8) contains only the **type definitions** and a trivial
construction smoke. It does *not*:

- render the full arg list,
- spawn the offline-host,
- wire into CI,
- touch `Replay.lean` or `EvmReplay.lean`.

Those are follow-ups (Step B), gated on the stub compiling cleanly and a parity smoke
passing.

## 8. Optional stub: `NearReplay.lean` (this step)

Because NEAR is confirmed easy and the stub is purely additive (no existing replay
behavior changes), this step delivers a minimal type-only stub:

- `ProofForge/Backend/Quint/NearReplay.lean` — `NearReplayConfig`,
  `NearReplayError`, the arg-encoding helpers (`encodeArgLe`), and a
  `renderOfflineHostArgs` skeleton that builds the arg list for a trace (v1 shape:
  mutating step + trailing getter). It reuses `Replay.resolveActionName` /
  `Replay.entrypointMap` / `Replay.buildArgs` and `ITF.parse`.
- `Tests/Quint/NearReplaySmoke.lean` — constructs a `NearReplayConfig` and renders a
  small synthetic trace's arg list, asserting the arg string contains the expected
  export names. Does **not** spawn `quint` or the offline-host; pure string check.
- `justfile` recipe `quint-near-replay-smoke`, wired into `just check` is **not** added
  (the constraint says do not wire into CI if it can't run end-to-end here; the smoke
  is a pure-Lean string check, so it *can* run here, but we keep it out of `just check`
  to avoid expanding the default gate surface without a parity decision — it is a
  standalone recipe instead).

The stub is **not** wired into any `*-backend-replay-gate.sh`. It only proves the shim
types can be built and the arg-list renderer is deterministic.

## 8.1 Field-level design: `SolanaReplay` (stub landed)

Solana is the 2nd C-diff candidate. Unlike NEAR (whose executor is a CLI arg
list), Solana's executable artifact is an sBPF ELF (`.so`) driven by
**Mollusk** — a Rust crate (`mollusk_svm`) invoked as a Rust test harness
(there is no Mollusk CLI). The shim therefore renders a **Rust test file**
that calls `Mollusk::new(&pid, "<elf>")` and `m.process_instruction(...)` per
trace step, mirroring the in-tree template `Tests/solana/counter_mollusk.rs.tpl`
and the testkit harness (`testkit/harness-solana/src/lib.rs`). This is the
EVM-shim shape (render a test file the target toolchain — here `cargo test` —
executes) rather than the NEAR-shim shape (render a CLI arg list).

### 8.1.1 Config

```lean
structure SolanaReplayConfig where
  programPath : String          -- path to the emitted sBPF ELF (`.so`), passed to `Mollusk::new`
  keypairPath : String          -- program keypair JSON; program id = first 32 bytes
  stateAccountDataLen : Nat     -- byte length of the state account data (e.g. 8 for Counter's u64)
  primaryStateVar : String      -- ITF/IR state variable name being checked (e.g. `count`)
  primaryStateByteSize : Nat    -- byte size of the primary scalar (e.g. 8 for u64)
```

This mirrors `EvmReplayConfig` (`bytecodeHex` / `readSignature` /
`primaryStateVar`) but with Solana artifact paths and an account-data length
instead of a Solidity getter signature. The `primaryStateByteSize` is used to
render the expected little-endian byte array (`renderLeBytes`) and to slice
return data.

### 8.1.2 Account-model translation

IR flat state vs Solana's account model (one account per state field group,
with the program as owner) is bridged by the shim as follows:

- `program_id` is the first 32 bytes of the keypair JSON (rendered as a
  `program_id()` fn, identical to the in-tree Mollusk template and the testkit
  harness).
- `accounts` is a single writable state account owned by the program (v1
  scalar-state shape, matching `SolanaModulePlan.accounts[0]` for the
  Counter). Multi-account / PDA / CPI translation is deferred — v1 covers the
  same scalar-state subset as EVM/NEAR v1.
- `instruction_data` is the entrypoint discriminator (1-byte internal tag or
  8-byte external selector parsed from `Entrypoint.selector?`) followed by the
  little-endian encoding of the IR arguments. The shim reuses
  `Manifest.externalDiscriminatorBytes?` so the discriminator it renders
  matches what `Manifest.buildInstructions` and the sBPF dispatch prologue
  emit, without requiring a full `SolanaModulePlan` build at replay time.

The IR → artifact call mapping for each ITF state after the first:

1. `actionName ← resolveActionName module state.actionTaken state.nondetPicks`
   (shared `Replay`). The Quint `init` action is mapped to the IR
   `initialize` entrypoint (mirroring NearReplay's init handling).
2. `entrypoint ← entrypointMap module |>.get? resolvedName` (shared `Replay`).
3. `args ← buildArgs entrypoint state.nondetPicks` (shared `Replay`) — `Array
   IR.Semantics.Value`.
4. `instructionData ← discriminatorBytes ep tag ++ encodeArgsLe args` — the
   Solana-specific step. `encodeArgLe` encodes each scalar arg as
   little-endian bytes (`u8`/`u32`/`u64`/`u128`/`bool`), matching the
   `le-u64`/`le-u32`/`u8-bool` encodings in `Manifest.instructionParamEncoding`
   and `portable_input_bytes_le` in the testkit core.
5. The rendered `#[test] fn test_step_<idx>()` seeds the state account with the
   previous step's primary value, issues the instruction, and asserts.

### 8.1.3 Observation and comparison

Two assertion shapes, depending on whether the entrypoint is a read or a
mutating call:

- **Read entrypoint** (`ep.returns != .unit`): the primary value comes back as
  return data. The test asserts `result.return_data == vec![<expected le
  bytes>]`.
- **Mutating entrypoint**: the primary value is written to the account data.
  The test fetches `result.get_account(&counter)` and asserts
  `after.data == vec![<expected le bytes>]`.

This is the v1 single-scalar shape (mirrors EVM v1's `assertEq(readState...)`
after each step). Full state-diff comparison (v2) is deferred.

### 8.1.4 Rendering shape

```lean
def renderReplayHarness (module : IR.Module) (trace : ITF.Trace)
    (cfg : SolanaReplayConfig) : Except SolanaReplayError String := do
  -- produces a self-contained Rust test file:
  --   #![cfg(test)]
  --   use { mollusk_svm::Mollusk, ... };
  --   fn program_id() -> Address { ... }
  --   fn mollusk() -> Mollusk { ... }
  --   fn ix(pid, data, counter) -> Instruction { ... }
  --   #[test] fn test_step_<idx>() { ... }   -- one per trace step
```

The wrapping test (Step B, follow-up) would: emit the Quint model, run
`quint run --mbt --out-itf`; emit the ELF (`proof-forge emit --target
solana-sbpf-asm` + `sbpf build` + `solana-keygen`); call
`SolanaReplay.renderReplayHarness` to get the Rust test source; scaffold a
Mollusk-bearing Cargo crate (mirroring `testkit/harness-solana` /
`Tests/solana/counter_mollusk.rs.tpl`); run `cargo test`; parse the result and
print `PASS`/`FAIL`.

### 8.1.5 What is NOT in the stub (this step)

The stub delivered here contains only the **type definitions** and the full
`renderReplayHarness` string renderer (one `#[test]` per trace step). It does
*not*:

- emit the ELF or scaffold the Cargo crate,
- spawn `cargo test`, `sbpf`, `solana-keygen`, or `quint`,
- wire into CI / `just check`,
- touch `Replay.lean`, `EvmReplay.lean`, or `NearReplay.lean`,
- handle multi-account / PDA / CPI translation (v1 scalar-state only).

Those are follow-ups (Step B), gated on the stub compiling cleanly and the SBF
platform-tools being available in the run environment.

## 9. Migration / growth path

```text
EVM (done)  ->  NEAR (stub landed)  ->  Solana (stub landed)  ->  Psy  ->  (research spikes)
```

- **NEAR (Step B, follow-up):** implement the full `renderOfflineHostArgs` + the
  `CounterNearReplay.lean` test that spawns `quint` + offline-host, add
  `scripts/quint/near-backend-replay-gate.sh` + `just quint-near-backend-replay-gate`,
  wire into `just quint-ir-model-gate` after parity.
- **Solana (2nd, stub landed):** `SolanaReplay.lean` renders a Rust Mollusk
  test file (option (a) from the original design: render a Rust test that calls
  `mollusk_svm::Mollusk` directly, mirroring EVM's Solidity test rendering).
  Option (b) (testkit scenario TOML) was rejected for v1 as more coupling for
  less self-containment. The account-model translation (instruction
  discriminator from `Entrypoint.selector?` + single writable state account +
  instruction-data bytes) is the main extra work vs NEAR. The
  `SolanaModulePlan` (Phase 2, landed) already exposes the
  discriminator/account schema; the shim re-derives the discriminator via
  `Manifest.externalDiscriminatorBytes?` to avoid requiring a full plan build
  at replay time. The stub (`ProofForge/Backend/Quint/SolanaReplay.lean` +
  `Tests/Quint/SolanaReplaySmoke.lean` + `just quint-solana-replay-smoke`) is
  **not** wired into `just check` (running end-to-end needs SBF platform-tools
  not installed here per AGENTS.md). Step B (emit the ELF + `cargo test` +
  gate script + `just quint-solana-backend-replay-gate`) is a follow-up.
- **Psy (3rd, deferred on tool):** `PsyReplay.lean` renders a `dargo execute` script.
  Blocked on `dargo` not being installed here per AGENTS.md. Design-only until the tool
  is available; the shim shape is straightforward (Psy entrypoint → dargo call).
- **Move-Sui / Aleo / Cloudflare (deferred, research spikes):** these backends have no
  real lowering (Move-Sui is a Counter MVP template; Aleo/Cloudflare are research
  spikes). A C-diff replay requires a real artifact to replay against, which requires a
  real lowering first. Deferred to Phase 6+ per the Tier B multi-backend design.

Each backend adds: one `*Replay.lean`, one `Tests/Quint/*Replay.lean`, one
`scripts/quint/*-backend-replay-gate.sh`, one `justfile` recipe. The shared
`Replay.lean` and the testkit Quint harness are unchanged.

## 10. Deferred backends — rationale

### 10.1 Psy (deferred — 3rd)

`dargo` is not installed in this environment (per AGENTS.md, `just psy-all` needs
`dargo`). The Psy backend has a real lowering and a `PsyModulePlan`, so the *design* is
feasible, but the execution environment is not available here. A `PsyReplay.lean` stub
could be written design-only, but unlike NEAR there is no in-tree executor to validate
even the stub against. Deferred until `dargo` is installable or a parity host exists.

### 10.2 Solana (stub landed — 2nd)

Solana is feasible (Mollusk is in-tree as a Rust crate, `sbpf` + `solana-keygen` are
installed). It was the 2nd C-diff candidate (after NEAR) and its additive type-only
stub has now landed: `ProofForge/Backend/Quint/SolanaReplay.lean` +
`Tests/Quint/SolanaReplaySmoke.lean` + `just quint-solana-replay-smoke` (not wired
into `just check`). The account-model translation (instruction discriminator,
account meta list, instruction-data byte layout) is the main extra work vs NEAR
(NEAR exports map 1:1 to entrypoints and inputs are a flat byte stream). The
`SolanaModulePlan` already exposes the discriminator and account schema; the
shim re-derives the discriminator from `Entrypoint.selector?` via
`Manifest.externalDiscriminatorBytes?` to avoid requiring a full plan build at
replay time. The full end-to-end gate (Step B: emit the ELF via `sbpf build`,
spawn `cargo test`, parse results) is a follow-up gated on the SBF
platform-tools being available in the run environment. See §8.1 for the
field-level design.

### 10.3 Move-Sui (deferred — research spike)

`Move/Sui.lean` is a hardcoded Counter MVP template (~80 LOC of string interpolation).
There is no real lowering, no `Ctx`, no plan. A C-diff replay needs a real artifact to
replay against; the MVP template cannot consume arbitrary IR modules. A `SuiModulePlan`
must precede a real Move lowering (Phase 6+ per the Tier B design). Deferred.

### 10.4 Aleo (deferred — research spike)

`Aleo/IR.lean` lowers to a Leo program via `Compiler.Leo.Emit`. `leo` is installed, but
the backend is a research spike (not in `--list-targets` registry; CLI-only via
`emit --target aleo-leo`). A `LeoReplay` shim would render a `leo run` invocation, but
the Leo execution model (circuit-based) differs enough from IR semantics that the
observable comparison is not straightforward. Deferred.

### 10.5 Cloudflare (deferred — research spike)

No `ProofForge/Backend/Cloudflare` directory exists; the Cloudflare workers backend is
a research spike listed in AGENTS.md but not present as a backend module. Deferred
until a real backend module exists.

### 10.6 CosmWasm (deferred — no local env)

CosmWasm would clone the NEAR WAT pattern, but there is no local wasmtime/host executor
for CosmWasm in-tree (the testkit has no CosmWasm harness). Deferred until a local
executor exists.

## 11. RFC 0014 update summary

RFC 0014 Tier C-diff (en + zh) is updated to:

- Record the audit results: EVM has C-diff coverage; NEAR is the chosen next
  candidate (stub landed); Solana is 2nd (stub landed); Psy is 3rd
  (tool-blocked); Move-Sui / Aleo / Cloudflare are deferred (research spikes /
  no real lowering).
- Record the abstract replay interface (config + `renderReplayHarness` + observation),
  generalizing from `EvmReplay`, and note that the shared `Replay.lean` is the
  chain-neutral trace interpreter every shim reuses.
- Point to this document for the per-backend feasibility table and the field-level
  `NearReplay` (§7) and `SolanaReplay` (§8.1) designs.
- Note the minimal additive stubs (`NearReplay.lean` + smoke, `SolanaReplay.lean`
  + smoke) and that neither is wired into CI.
- Keep Phase 5 Path 5a scope as a *plan + stub*, not a full implementation.

## 12. Open questions

- Should `NearReplay` v1 read back state after *every* mutating step (mirroring EVM v1)
  or only at trace end? Recommendation: after every step (matches EVM v1, catches
  mid-trace divergence).
- Should the offline-host grow a `--expect` flag so the comparison happens in-process
  (closer to EVM's in-test `assertEq`) rather than the Lean test parsing stdout?
  Recommendation: keep stdout parsing for v1 (no offline-host changes); revisit in v2.
- Should `SolanaReplay` render a Rust test (option a) or a testkit scenario TOML
  (option b)? **Resolved:** option (a) — render a Rust Mollusk test file
  (mirrors EVM's Solidity test rendering and the in-tree
  `Tests/solana/counter_mollusk.rs.tpl` template). Landed in the stub; revisit
  if the testkit scenario path proves reusable.
- Should the abstract replay interface become a Lean typeclass? Inherited open
  question from RFC 0014 Phase 7; the per-backend harness shapes differ enough that a
  typeclass is not obviously worth it yet.

## 13. Non-goals

- **Executing the NEAR artifact in Lean.** The offline-host (wasmtime) executes it; the
  shim only renders the arg list.
- **Changing `Replay.lean` or `EvmReplay.lean`.** The stub is additive and imports the
  shared replay helpers unchanged.
- **Wiring a new gate into `just check` or CI.** The stub is a standalone smoke; full
  wiring is Step B.
- **Tier C-proof.** This is differential testing (Tier C-diff), not a proof.
- **A single global `*Replay` type.** Each backend's shim is target-specific, mirroring
  RFC 0004's non-goal on plan types.

## 15. Multi-module C-diff rendering (2026-07-07 update)

The original shims were type-only stubs that each rendered a harness for a
single module (Counter). They have been generalized to render sensible
harnesses for multiple modules per backend, proving they are not
Counter-specific. The generalization is pure Lean string rendering — no
external tool execution, no new gates wired into `just check`.

### 15.1 What was hard-coded to Counter

| Shim | Counter-only constraint | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `EvmReplay` | rejected entrypoints with params ("EVM replay v1 does not encode entrypoint args"); init hard-coded `initialize()`; `init` step guarded `expected != 0` | `renderMutatingStep` / `renderReadStep` / `renderInitStep` |
| `NearReplay` | the `init` branch hard-coded `("initialize", "")`, dropping any args the module's `initialize` takes (e.g. ValueVault's `initialize(initial)`); the render otherwise already encoded args via `buildArgs` + `encodeArgsLe`, so the only Counter-only-ness was the init step + the smoke only constructing a Counter config + trace | `renderStep` |
| `SolanaReplay` | hard-coded a single writable state account named `counter` with `cfg.stateAccountDataLen` bytes; read back only `cfg.primaryStateVar` as a scalar at offset 0; assumed every module has an `initialize` entrypoint | `renderTraceStep` |

### 15.2 Modules now rendered per shim

| Shim | Modules | Why chosen | Non-scalar state? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EvmReplay` | `Counter` (scalar, nullary), `ValueVault` (6 scalars, entrypoints with args) | ValueVault is the natural C-diff target `Evm.Refinement` already builds trace obligations for; its entrypoints take ABI args (`initialize(uint256)`, `deposit(uint256)`, `charge_fee(uint256,uint256)`, `release(uint256)`), exercising the generalized arg encoder | No (multi-scalar) |
| `NearReplay` | `Counter`, `ValueVault` | ValueVault WAT exists (`Examples/Backend/WasmNear/ValueVault.golden.wat`); the render is already module-agnostic, so multi-module coverage comes from the smoke supplying a ValueVault config + trace | No (multi-scalar) |
| `SolanaReplay` | `Counter`, `ValueVault`, `EvmMapProbe` (sub-module) | ValueVault exercises plan-driven multi-scalar account seeding (6 u64 scalars, account `balance` dataSize=48); EvmMapProbe exercises non-scalar (map) state and the v1 degradation path | Yes (map: `balances`) |

### 15.3 Routing through the `*ModulePlan`

- **EVM:** the render function was generalized (not routed through
  `Evm.Plan.ModulePlan`). `renderMutatingStep` / `renderReadStep` / `renderInitStep`
  now encode entrypoint args via `buildArgs` + a new `renderAbiArgList` helper.
  The Counter path (nullary entrypoints) renders byte-identically to the v1
  output (verified by a stash-diff). The existing `mbt-replay-gate.sh` /
  `CounterEvmReplay.lean` consumer is unaffected.
- **NEAR:** the `init` branch of `renderStep` was generalized to look up the
  module's `initialize` entrypoint and encode its args from the ITF nondet
  picks (previously it hard-coded `("initialize", "")`, dropping args). The
  Counter path (nullary `initialize`) renders byte-identically. The smoke now
  also covers ValueVault.
- **Solana:** routed through the `SolanaModulePlan` (Tier B), as the task
  suggested. `renderReplayHarness` builds a `SolanaModulePlan` and derives a
  `SolanaReplayPlan` (state account name + data length + account-meta list +
  primary scalar field offset/size) from it. The account list and state layout
  now come from the plan rather than the hard-coded "single writable counter
  account". If the plan build fails (a module the Solana backend does not
  lower), the shim falls back to the config-derived single-account shape so it
  degrades gracefully.

### 15.4 Non-scalar state handling (Solana v1)

For modules whose primary state is a map or array (e.g. `EvmMapProbe`'s
`balances` map), the Solana account holds the *serialized* state, not a single
scalar. The v1 shim observes only the primary scalar: it looks up
`cfg.primaryStateVar` in `plan.stateFields`, keeping only fields with
`kind == "scalar"` and `byteSize > 0`. If the primary var is a map/array
(no scalar field by that name), `primaryFieldOffset? := none` and the
read-back assertion is skipped — the harness still renders without crashing,
proving the shim is not Counter-specific. Full map/array state-diff
observation is a v2 follow-up.

### 15.5 Smokes

- `Tests/Quint/EvmReplaySmoke.lean` (new) — pure string-render check for
  `Counter` + `ValueVault`; asserts the encoded arg literals and read-back
  assertions appear.
- `Tests/Quint/NearReplaySmoke.lean` — extended to render `Counter` +
  `ValueVault`; asserts the export names and `--inputs-hex` flag.
- `Tests/Quint/SolanaReplaySmoke.lean` — extended to render `Counter` +
  `ValueVault` + `EvmMapProbe` (map sub-module); asserts the plan-derived
  account bindings, data lengths, and the non-scalar skip comment.

None are wired into `just check` (they are pure string-render checks; the
end-to-end gates remain Step B follow-ups, same as the pre-existing NEAR/Solana
smokes).
